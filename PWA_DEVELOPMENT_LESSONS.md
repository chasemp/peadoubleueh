## üìä **Project Sources**

This comprehensive guide was compiled from lessons learned during the development of:

- **Blockdoku PWA** - Puzzle game with complex state management
- **CannonPop PWA** - Physics-based game with mobile optimization
- **BustAGroove PWA** - Music game with local library dependencies
- **MealPlanner PWA** - Data-heavy app with testing strategies

### **üîÑ Major Refactoring Case Study: Blockdoku PWA**

**The Challenge:** Transform a 3,741-line monolithic PWA into a clean, modular architecture while maintaining 100% behavioral compatibility.

**The Solution:** Testing-first refactoring with comprehensive test coverage (66 tests, 100% pass rate).

**Key Achievements:**
- **89% Code Reduction** - From 3,741 to 400 lines in main app file
- **Zero Breaking Changes** - All original functionality preserved
- **Modular Architecture** - 4 focused, testable components
- **Complete Test Coverage** - Characterization, unit, and integration tests

**Lessons Learned:**
- **Testing Foundation is Critical** - 66 tests made refactoring possible
- **Characterization Tests First** - Capture current behavior before changes
- **Component-by-Component Extraction** - One component at a time with tests
- **Dependency Injection Enables Testing** - Makes components testable and flexible
- **State Management Centralization** - Single source of truth for all state

**Detailed Documentation:**
- **[Technical Implementation Guide](./PWA_TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md#pwa-refactoring-from-monolith-to-modular-architecture)** - Complete refactoring case study
- **[Development Workflow Guide](./PWA_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md#testing-strategy-for-pwa-refactoring)** - Testing strategies for safe refactoring

### **üö® CRITICAL: Source vs Build File Confusion (Oct 2025)**

**The Most Destructive Architectural Issue Across All PWA Projects**

#### The Problem
The single most damaging mistake made across multiple PWA projects was **mixing source and built files** in the same directory structure.

**Symptoms experienced:**
- ‚ùå Weeks lost to circular debugging
- ‚ùå Multiple PRs fixing "bugs" that were just stale builds
- ‚ùå Developers (human and AI) editing wrong files
- ‚ùå Changes mysteriously disappearing  
- ‚ùå Live sites serving old content while source was updated
- ‚ùå Build timestamps causing endless commit churn
- ‚ùå Impossible to know "which file is the latest version"

**Real example from Blockdoku:** PR #92 "Investigate hidden game setting implementation" - Settings weren't visible not because of broken code, but because the deployed built files were stale while source files had the fix.

#### Root Causes
1. **Unclear Separation** - No obvious distinction between source and built files
2. **Building to Root** - Vite/build tools configured with `outDir: '../'`
3. **Manual Build Process** - Easy to forget `npm run build` before committing
4. **No Protections** - Nothing prevented editing built files
5. **Documentation Collision** - `/docs` used for project docs instead of builds
6. **Build Metadata Churn** - Timestamp files changed every build, creating commit noise

#### The Solution: /src ‚Üí /docs Pattern

**New Architecture (October 2025):**
```
your-pwa/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/          ‚Üí Source code (EDIT HERE)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/         ‚Üí Built output (AUTO-GENERATED)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-docs/ ‚Üí Project documentation (if needed)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ public/       ‚Üí Static assets
```

**4 Layers of Protection:**
1. `.gitattributes` - Marks `/docs` as generated
2. `.cursorrules` - Warns AI assistants
3. HTML comments - Warns human developers
4. Comprehensive documentation

**Pre-commit Hook:** Automates tests + build, prevents forgetting

**Build Metadata Strategy:**
- Root `build`, `build-info.json` ‚Üí gitignored (prevent churn)
- Hook copies them to `/docs` for deployment
- Only `/docs` versions committed
- Result: Clean commits, no timestamp noise

**Impact:**
- **Before:** Constant confusion, lost work, stale deployments
- **After:** Clear workflow, automatic builds, reliable deployments

**Complete Guide:** See [Development Workflow - Deployment Pattern](./PWA_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md#critical-the-src--docs-deployment-pattern)

**This architectural pattern is now mandatory for all new PWA projects.**
