## 🎯 **What is a PWA?**

A **Progressive Web App (PWA)** is a web application that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users.

### **Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Installable** - Users can install from browser, no app store needed
- ✅ **Offline-First** - Works without internet connection
- ✅ **Mobile-Optimized** - Touch-friendly, responsive design
- ✅ **Fast** - Service worker caching for instant loading
- ✅ **Secure** - HTTPS required, secure by default
- ✅ **Cross-Platform** - One codebase works everywhere

### **Real Examples:**
- **[pea.523.life](https://pea.523.life)** - Our PWA template
- **[giffer.523.life](https://giffer.523.life)** - Video to GIF converter
- **[mealplanner.523.life](https://mealplanner.523.life)** - Meal planning app

# Your PWA is ready! 🎉
```

### **Option 2: Start From Scratch**

```bash
# Create new project
mkdir my-pwa && cd my-pwa
npm init -y

# Install Vite (recommended build tool)
npm install --save-dev vite

# Create basic structure
mkdir -p src public
```
